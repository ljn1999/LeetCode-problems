# LeetCode-problems
Personal practice on LeetCode problems. Plan to upload 1 personal python3 solution per day :-).

All solutions get accepted, but efficiency is not guaranteed.

Update on 2020.09.25:
Try to clear my mind and figure things out, might solve one problem for more than a day.

Update on 2020.10.14:
Perhaps will not continue on the repo this year lol, will come back when I finish my current tasks.

Finally finished my GRE test and enjoyed several chill weeks :-) Glad to be back at the very end of 2020! Merry Christmas and happy new year! Hopefully I could resume it as my daily practice.
