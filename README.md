# LeetCode-problems
Personal practice on LeetCode problems. Plan to upload 1 personal python3 solution per day :-).

All solutions get accepted, but efficiency is not guaranteed.

Update on 2020.09.25:
Try to clear my mind and figure things out, might solve one problem for more than a day.

Update on 2020.10.14:
Perhaps will not continue on the repo this year lol, will come back when I finish my current tasks.

Finally finished my GRE test and enjoyed several chill weeks :-) Glad to be back at the very end of 2020! Merry Christmas and happy new year! Hopefully I could resume it as my daily practice.

Update on 2021.04.06:
As some leetcode problems are locked unless I subscribe, I would have to skip them for now.

最近一个多月都没做，说实话sql忘得差不多了，不想跳过但又不想复习，以后再说吧。

Happy new year! Feeling confused, lost and unmotivated for so many things... In the last term @ UofT my only mission is to graduate :-). Will resume daily practice this summer.

F1 VISA got checked. Fingers crossed! Plz let me gooooo. Meanwhile I'll do leetcode problems to distract myself from the painful wait.

Finally got my F1 VISA issued and got my passport back! Hope everything goes well with my flight back to China tonight.
